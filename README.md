# MeadowGum

The `MeadowGum` project attempts to make it easy to quickly lay out and add functionality to complex user interfaces for embedded devices utilizing the [Wilderness Labs Meadow](https://www.wildernesslabs.co/).  

Rapid user interface are laid out with the [Gum](https://docs.flatredball.com/gum/) tool.  As screens and components are laid out, the tool automatically generates C# code to add functionality to the interface easy, with many aspects being statically checked at compile time.

A demonstration of `MeadowGum` in action can be seen in the video below:
